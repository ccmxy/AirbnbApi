      if (!yourKey)
        h1 The button above generates an API key and saves it in a MongoDb.
        h2 Once you have generated it, a demo with pre-loaded cURL commands will appear below.
      if (yourKey)
        h3 Your API key is...
         br
         br
         span #{yourKey}
        p Along with being able to read data, this randomly generated token (which is called "appid" in the api) will enable you to also write, delete, and update the airbnbportal database!
        if (yourKey)
          h4 First, delete the "Cozy Cottage" listing, just in case it's there from an old demo...:
            div(class="element-demo")
             p(class="digits") curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'appid=#{yourKey}&name=Cozy+Cottage' "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/delete"
          h4 Create new listing, "Cozy Cottage" with /addlisting:
            div(class="element-demo")
              p(class="digits") curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'appid=#{yourKey}&name=Cozy+Cottage&city=Portland&state=OR&noGuests=2&price=40' "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/addlisting"
          p The only required params of /addlisting are your token (appid) and a unique listing name.
          h4 View all the of listings in the Portland, Oregon:
              div(class="element-demo")
                p(class="digits") curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: text/plain" "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/getlistingsbylocation/?city=Portland&State=OR"
          p You should get back a JSON of all listings in Portland, OR.
          h4 Update the listing with http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/updatelistingbyname:
            div(class="element-demo")
              p(class="digits") curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'appid=#{yourKey}&name=Beach+Bungalo&city=Newport&state=OR&noGuests=2&price=99' "https://airbnbportal.appspot.com/updatelistingbyname"
            p There is also a route to update by the listing's id, which is http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/update. It would be called like:
            code curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'appid=#{yourKey}&id=ListingObjectId&name=DesiredName&city=CityName&state=StateName&noGuests=2&price=99' "https://airbnbportal.appspot.com/update
            br
            p (Node implementation of this route further down.)

          h4 Finally, remove the listing:
            div(class="element-demo")
              p(class="digits") curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'appid=#{yourKey}&name=Beach+Bungalo' "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/delete"
      p You can also these URIs in your own applications.
      h4 Update a listing with javascript on a machine that has node.js installed:
      p Create a javascript file in any empty directory, open the command line, and from
       within the directory of your new javascript file, enter this into the command line:
        br
        code npm install request
        br
      p Then paste this into the javascript file and save:
      iframe(type='text/html' width='640' height='390'
          src='//jsfiddle.net/7dx5838s/embedded/' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen'
          frameborder='0')
      p Then run it with
       br
       code node nameOfJavascriptFile.js
       br
       and you will have successfully updated a listing.
      p Here are some other routes:
      h4 Get all listings:
      div(class="element-demo")
        p(class="digits") curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: text/plain"  "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/getlistings"
      h4 Get listings by location:
      div(class="element-demo")
        p(class="digits") curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  'city=CityLocation&state=StateLocation' "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/getlistingsbylocation‚Äù
      p Note: You can optionally choose to only send in a city or state, and it will still work for that area.
      h4 The /delete route also works by object id:
      div(class="element-demo")
        p(class="digits") curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'appid=yourGeneratedToken&id=idOfListingToDelete' "http://airbnbportal.appspot.com/delete"
      a(href='/') Home
